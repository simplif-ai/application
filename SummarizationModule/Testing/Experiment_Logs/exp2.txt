Experiment 2: Operation Wild Crayon

Goal: In order to speed up the summarizer, we want to avoid scanning all
nouns in the entire document for every new noun added to the lexical chains.
Nouns at the beginning of the document do not contribute to the context of
newer nouns. Thus, we wish to limit the number of nouns checked using a 
queue.

Text(s) used:
sample.txt (4773 char)
sample_long.txt (13544 char)

Experiment Log:
10/22 10:59PM
Original code with sample.txt
24.3

10/22 11:07PM
Modified with queue length 20 on sample.txt
1.96
Comments: summary was pretty bad, gonna investigate
whoops, had a bug

10/22 11:19PM
Modified with queue length 20 on sample.txt
17.9
Comments: summary was almost as good, time was sped up

10/22 11:30PM
Modified with queue length 10 on sample.txt
23.8
Comments: summary was very good

10/22 11:33PM
Original code for sample_long.txt (0.4 proportion)
440

10/22 11:37PM
Modified with queue length 10 on sample_long.txt
176

Results: Looks like adding this queue preserves summary quality and simultaneously
speeds up summarizer for long texts. We will be keeping this queue.
