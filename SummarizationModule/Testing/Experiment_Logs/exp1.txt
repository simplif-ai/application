Experiment 1: Operation Beacon Warehouse

Goal: In order to speed up the summarizer, we want to dynamically
update strength and score instead of recomputing it every time it
is needed. Our hypothesis is that doing so will reduce the runtime
complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2).

Experiment Log:
10/19 12:08AM
Original code
36.8

10/19 12:12AM
Update strength dynamically
23.76

10/19 12:18AM
Update score dynamically
23.7

Results: It seems we are headed in the right direction for our hypothesis.
Results seem very positive, so this change will be pushed to our codebase.
