Experiment 3: Operation Intense Gamma

Goal: In order to speed up the summarizer, we want to avoid having too many
small lexical chains in a lexical chain group. We solve this by filtering out
smaller lexical chains as more chains are added.

Text(s) used:
sample.txt (4773 char)
sample_long.txt (13544 char)

Experiment Log:
10/24 8:25PM
Original code with sample.txt
26

10/24 8:32PM
Modified code with chain cap 6 with sample.txt
11.74

10/28 8:54PM
Modified code with chain cap 6 for sample_long.txt
83.2

10/28 9:02PM
Modified code with chain cap (num sentences // 3 + 1) for sample_long.txt
843

10/28 9:20PM
Modified code with chain cap (num sentences // 6 + 1) for sample_long.txt
482

Results: Looks like filtering lexical chains preserves summary quality and simultaneously
speeds up summarizer for long texts. We will be keeping this filter.
